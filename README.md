# PicoVM #

A microscopic virtual machine.

## What is PicoVM? ##

A small and relatively crappy virtual machine I wrote for fun and
self-instruction. It is not particularly capable; it can perform
arithmetic and is able to move values between registers and virtual
memory. Currently, no logic is natively supported and is unlikely to
be added. Again, I wrote this for fun, as an intermediate C project,
and is unlikely to be of any actual use to anyone.
